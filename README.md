# CloudLabIDE

This repository contains CloudFormation templates to quickly set up VSCode (code-server) instances in us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions. Templates are pre-configured with necessary permissions and are ready to be used for cloud security-related workshops or development.

> **Authored by:** Anjali Singh Shukla & Divyanshu Shukla

## Security Notice

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These templates store VSCode passwords in **plain text** in the code-server configuration file. This is acceptable for **lab and training environments only** and is **NOT recommended for production use**.

### Required AWS Permissions

The IAM user/role deploying this stack requires the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:CreateStack",
        "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
        "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
        "ec2:*",
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:DeleteRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
        "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
        "iam:DeleteInstanceProfile",
        "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
        "iam:RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
        "secretsmanager:DeleteSecret",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "cloudfront:CreateDistribution",
        "cloudfront:DeleteDistribution",
        "cloudfront:GetDistribution",
        "cloudfront:UpdateDistribution"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** For production environments, restrict `Resource: "*"` to specific ARNs. The stack uses `AdministratorAccess` policy for the EC2 instance role to facilitate workshop activities.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Choose your Region and OS**: Use the table above to pick your region and OS type, then launch the CloudFormation stack.

2. **Monitor the Stack Creation**: The stack will take about 10 minutes to complete.

3. **Access the CloudFormation Outputs**: Once the stack creation is complete, retrieve the outputs.

    - CloudFrontUrl
        - To access the cloudFront url for the VSCode access
    - SecretsManagerUrl
        - Retrieve the secret to access the VSCode IDE.

5. Access the `CloudFrontUrl` & follow next steps from [terraform-eks](https://github.com/kubernetesvillage/terraform-eks) to deploy `eks cluster`.

### Cleanup

To avoid unnecessary costs, be sure to delete the CloudFormation stacks and any created AWS resources once you're finished.

- To delete the VSCode instance, run the following command:

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name securitydojo-eks-workshop
    ```

- Follow the cleanup instructions for the EKS resources, either through `eksctl` or Terraform.
