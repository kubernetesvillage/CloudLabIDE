## Prerequisites

Before running the `deploy.sh` script, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- Git
- AWS CLI
- Terraform

### Install Git

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
```

#### Amazon Linux 2

```bash
sudo yum install -y git
```

#### CentOS/RHEL

```bash
sudo yum install -y git
```

### Install AWS CLI and Terraform

These tools will be installed automatically by the `deploy.sh` script if they are not already installed on your system.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kubernetesvillage/vscode-eks.git
    cd vscode-eks
    ```

2. **Pre-Deployment**

   > Run the pre-deploy.sh script to ensure all necessary dependencies (AWS CLI, Terraform, etc.) are installed.
   ```bash
    bash pre-deploy.sh
    ```
3. **Configure AWS CLI**

    > Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials.

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

## Deployment

- Run the `deploy.sh` script to deploy the infrastructure.

```bash
bash deploy.sh --region <your-region>
```

Replace `<your-region>` with your desired AWS region. If no region is provided, the script will default to `us-east-1`.

> Note: Currently supported regions are 'us-east-1' and 'us-west-2'.

- Open the IP address in the browser to access the vscode and enter the password shown in the output.


## TL;DR

1. **Install Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the `vscode-eks` repository.
3. **Configure AWS CLI**: Run `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials.
4. **Run Script**: Navigate to the repository directory and run the `deploy.sh` script with the desired AWS region.
